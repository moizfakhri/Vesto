    title: 'Basic Fundamentals',
    lesson: `Understanding financial fundamentals is crucial for analyzing any company. Let's explore the key metrics that investors use to evaluate businesses.

**P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)**: This shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. A P/E of 25 means investors pay $25 for every $1 of annual earnings. Higher P/E ratios often indicate growth expectations, but can also signal overvaluation.

**EBITDA**: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. This measures a company's operating profitability before accounting decisions and tax structures affect the numbers. It's useful for comparing companies across different tax jurisdictions.

**ROE (Return on Equity)**: Shows how efficiently a company uses shareholder equity to generate profits. ROE = Net Income / Shareholder Equity. A higher ROE generally indicates better management efficiency.

**D/E Ratio (Debt-to-Equity)**: Measures financial leverage by comparing total debt to shareholder equity. High D/E ratios can indicate higher risk but also potential for higher returns.

**Key Insight**: No single metric tells the whole story. Analysts compare multiple metrics and consider industry context, growth trends, and competitive positioning.`,

- Revenue streams and their relative importance
- Competitive positioning and market share
- Key partnerships and distribution channels
- Growth strategies and market opportunities

**Risk Factors Section**: Companies must disclose material risks that could affect their business. Common risks include:
- **Competition risks**: New entrants, pricing pressure, loss of market share
- **Regulatory risks**: Changing laws, compliance costs, potential fines
- **Operational risks**: Supply chain disruptions, key customer concentration
- **Market risks**: Economic downturns, currency fluctuations, interest rates

**Critical Analysis**: Don't just read the risks - evaluate their likelihood and potential impact. Compare how companies in the same industry describe similar risks. More specific, detailed risk disclosures often indicate better management awareness.`,

    title: '10-K: Financial Statements',
    lesson: `Financial statements are the quantitative heart of a 10-K report. Three core statements work together to show a company's financial health.

**Balance Sheet**: Shows what a company owns (assets), owes (liabilities), and the difference (equity) at a specific point in time.
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities (measures short-term liquidity)
- Look for trends in working capital and debt levels

**Income Statement**: Shows revenue, expenses, and profit over a period.
- Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue (shows pricing power)
- Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue (shows operational efficiency)
- Track revenue growth and margin trends

**Cash Flow Statement**: Shows actual cash movements, which can differ from accounting profits.
- Operating Cash Flow shows cash from core business
- Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - CapEx (cash available after investments)
- Healthy companies generate consistent positive operating cash flow

**Key Analysis Points**:
- Revenue growth alone isn't enough - check if it's profitable growth
- Compare margins to competitors to assess competitive position
- Cash flow is harder to manipulate than accounting earnings
- Look for discrepancies between profits and cash flow`,

    title: 'Competitive Analysis & Moats',
    lesson: `A company's competitive advantages ("moats") determine its ability to maintain profitability over time.

**Types of Economic Moats**:

1. **Network Effects**: Product becomes more valuable as more people use it (e.g., social media, payment networks)
2. **Switching Costs**: High cost or difficulty for customers to switch to competitors (e.g., enterprise software, bank accounts)
3. **Cost Advantages**: Ability to produce at lower cost than competitors (e.g., scale economies, proprietary technology)
4. **Intangible Assets**: Brand power, patents, regulatory licenses that competitors can't easily replicate
5. **Scale Economies**: Lower per-unit costs as volume increases

**Evaluating Moat Strength**:
- Stable or expanding profit margins over 5-10 years
- High returns on invested capital (ROIC > 15%)
- Pricing power (ability to raise prices without losing customers)
- Market share trends in core markets
- Barriers to entry for new competitors

**Competitive Risks**:
- Technology disruption
- Changing customer preferences
- Regulatory changes
- Market saturation
- Competitors' responses

**Analysis Framework**: A sustainable competitive advantage should explain why the company maintains high returns despite competition. Look for evidence in financial metrics, not just management claims.`,

    lesson: `Comparative analysis synthesizes everything you've learned to evaluate companies against each other.

**Framework for Comparison**:

1. **Business Quality**:
   - Which business model is more attractive?
   - Who has stronger competitive advantages?
   - Which faces less disruption risk?

2. **Financial Performance**:
   - Revenue growth rates and sustainability
   - Margin profiles and trends
   - Cash generation efficiency
   - Balance sheet strength

3. **Valuation**:
   - P/E ratios relative to growth (PEG ratio)
   - EV/EBITDA for capital-intensive businesses
   - Price/Sales for high-growth companies
   - Are higher valuations justified by superior metrics?

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Competitive threats
   - Regulatory exposure
   - Financial leverage
   - Execution risks

**Making the Decision**:
- Better business + reasonable valuation often beats cheaper but inferior business
- Consider margin of safety in valuation
- Weight qualitative factors (moats, management) with quantitative metrics
- Think about 3-5 year outlook, not just current metrics

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Focusing only on valuation without considering quality
- Extrapolating recent trends indefinitely
- Ignoring balance sheet risks
- Not considering whether growth is profitable`,

        question: 'Company A trades at P/E of 30 with 25% revenue growth and 40% margins. Company B trades at P/E of 15 with 5% growth and 20% margins. Which statement is most accurate?',
        options: [
          { label: 'A', text: 'Company B is clearly cheaper and better value' },
          { label: 'B', text: 'Company A is overvalued due to high P/E ratio' },
          { label: 'C', text: 'Company A\'s higher valuation may be justified by superior growth and margins' },
          { label: 'D', text: 'P/E ratios cannot be compared across companies' }
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'C',
        explanation: 'Valuation must be considered relative to quality. Company A\'s 5x higher growth rate and 2x better margins could justify a 2x higher P/E ratio. Quality businesses often deserve premium valuations.'
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        type: 'mcq',
        question: 'The PEG ratio (P/E divided by growth rate) helps evaluate:',

          { label: 'A', text: 'Only the P/E ratio' },

          { label: 'D', text: 'Only debt levels' }
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'B',
        explanation: 'PEG ratio adjusts P/E for growth rate, helping determine if a stock is fairly valued relative to its growth prospects. A PEG below 1.0 may indicate undervaluation relative to growth.'
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        type: 'mcq',
        question: 'When comparing two companies, you should prioritize:',

          { label: 'D', text: 'Ignoring valuation entirely' }
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'B',
        explanation: 'A margin of safety provides a buffer against estimation errors and unexpected challenges, buying below estimated fair value to protect against downside risk.'

          { label: 'D', text: 'Only small companies' }
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'B',
        explanation: 'EV/EBITDA normalizes for capital structure differences, making it useful for comparing companies with varying debt levels, especially in capital-intensive industries.'

        ],
        correctAnswer: 'B',
        explanation: 'Quality businesses with strong competitive advantages, superior growth, and high returns on capital often deserve premium valuations. The key is whether the premium is justified by fundamentals.'
