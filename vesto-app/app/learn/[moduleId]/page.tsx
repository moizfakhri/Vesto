    title: 'Basic Fundamentals',
    lesson: `Understanding financial fundamentals is crucial for analyzing any company. Let's explore the key metrics that investors use to evaluate businesses.

**P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)**: This shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. A P/E of 25 means investors pay $25 for every $1 of annual earnings. Higher P/E ratios often indicate growth expectations, but can also signal overvaluation.

**EBITDA**: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. This measures a company's operating profitability before accounting decisions and tax structures affect the numbers. It's useful for comparing companies across different tax jurisdictions.

**ROE (Return on Equity)**: Shows how efficiently a company uses shareholder equity to generate profits. ROE = Net Income / Shareholder Equity. A higher ROE generally indicates better management efficiency.

**D/E Ratio (Debt-to-Equity)**: Measures financial leverage by comparing total debt to shareholder equity. High D/E ratios can indicate higher risk but also potential for higher returns.

**Key Insight**: No single metric tells the whole story. Analysts compare multiple metrics and consider industry context, growth trends, and competitive positioning.`,

    title: '10-K: Business & Risk Factors',
    lesson: `The Business Description and Risk Factors sections of a 10-K report provide crucial qualitative information about a company.

**Business Description Section**: This describes what the company does, its products/services, target markets, competitive advantages, and business model. Look for:
- Revenue streams and their relative importance
- Competitive positioning and market share
- Key partnerships and distribution channels
- Growth strategies and market opportunities

**Risk Factors Section**: Companies must disclose material risks that could affect their business. Common risks include:
- **Competition risks**: New entrants, pricing pressure, loss of market share
- **Regulatory risks**: Changing laws, compliance costs, potential fines
- **Operational risks**: Supply chain disruptions, key customer concentration
- **Market risks**: Economic downturns, currency fluctuations, interest rates

**Critical Analysis**: Don't just read the risks - evaluate their likelihood and potential impact. Compare how companies in the same industry describe similar risks. More specific, detailed risk disclosures often indicate better management awareness.`,

    title: '10-K: Financial Statements',
    lesson: `Financial statements are the quantitative heart of a 10-K report. Three core statements work together to show a company's financial health.

**Balance Sheet**: Shows what a company owns (assets), owes (liabilities), and the difference (equity) at a specific point in time.
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities (measures short-term liquidity)
- Look for trends in working capital and debt levels

**Income Statement**: Shows revenue, expenses, and profit over a period.
- Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue (shows pricing power)
- Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue (shows operational efficiency)
- Track revenue growth and margin trends

**Cash Flow Statement**: Shows actual cash movements, which can differ from accounting profits.
- Operating Cash Flow shows cash from core business
- Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - CapEx (cash available after investments)
- Healthy companies generate consistent positive operating cash flow

**Key Analysis Points**:
- Revenue growth alone isn't enough - check if it's profitable growth
- Compare margins to competitors to assess competitive position
- Cash flow is harder to manipulate than accounting earnings
- Look for discrepancies between profits and cash flow`,

Is the company generating profitable growth? Are there any concerning trends in the relationships between revenue, profit, and cash flow?',

    title: 'Competitive Analysis & Moats',
    lesson: `A company's competitive advantages ("moats") determine its ability to maintain profitability over time.

**Types of Economic Moats**:

1. **Network Effects**: Product becomes more valuable as more people use it (e.g., social media, payment networks)
2. **Switching Costs**: High cost or difficulty for customers to switch to competitors (e.g., enterprise software, bank accounts)
3. **Cost Advantages**: Ability to produce at lower cost than competitors (e.g., scale economies, proprietary technology)
4. **Intangible Assets**: Brand power, patents, regulatory licenses that competitors can't easily replicate
5. **Scale Economies**: Lower per-unit costs as volume increases

**Evaluating Moat Strength**:
- Stable or expanding profit margins over 5-10 years
- High returns on invested capital (ROIC > 15%)
- Pricing power (ability to raise prices without losing customers)
- Market share trends in core markets
- Barriers to entry for new competitors

**Competitive Risks**:
- Technology disruption
- Changing customer preferences
- Regulatory changes
- Market saturation
- Competitors' responses

**Analysis Framework**: A sustainable competitive advantage should explain why the company maintains high returns despite competition. Look for evidence in financial metrics, not just management claims.`,

          { label: 'D', text: 'Low employee turnover' }
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'B',
        explanation: 'Consistently high ROIC over many years indicates the company can generate strong returns despite competition, suggesting a durable competitive advantage. Short-term metrics or size alone don\'t prove sustainable advantages.'

      {
        id: 2,
        type: 'written',
        question: 'Identify and analyze the competitive moats for your selected company. What type of moat do they possess (network effects, switching costs, cost advantages, brand, etc.)? Is this moat sustainable or at risk? Support your analysis with evidence from their business model, market position, and financial performance.',
        guidance: 'Be specific about the type of moat and provide concrete evidence. Consider potential threats to the moat and whether competitive advantages are strengthening or weakening. Use margin trends and market share as supporting evidence.'

  'module-5': {
    title: 'Expert: Comparative Analysis',
    lesson: `Comparative analysis synthesizes everything you've learned to evaluate companies against each other.

**Framework for Comparison**:

1. **Business Quality**:
   - Which business model is more attractive?
   - Who has stronger competitive advantages?
   - Which faces less disruption risk?

2. **Financial Performance**:
   - Revenue growth rates and sustainability
   - Margin profiles and trends
   - Cash generation efficiency
   - Balance sheet strength

3. **Valuation**:
   - P/E ratios relative to growth (PEG ratio)
   - EV/EBITDA for capital-intensive businesses
   - Price/Sales for high-growth companies
   - Are higher valuations justified by superior metrics?

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Competitive threats
   - Regulatory exposure
   - Financial leverage
   - Execution risks

**Making the Decision**:
- Better business + reasonable valuation often beats cheaper but inferior business
- Consider margin of safety in valuation
- Weight qualitative factors (moats, management) with quantitative metrics
- Think about 3-5 year outlook, not just current metrics

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Focusing only on valuation without considering quality
- Extrapolating recent trends indefinitely
- Ignoring balance sheet risks
- Not considering whether growth is profitable`,

          { label: 'D', text: 'P/E ratios cannot be compared across companies' }
        ],
        correctAnswer: 'C',
        explanation: 'Valuation must be considered relative to quality. Company A\'s 5x higher growth rate and 2x better margins could justify a 2x higher P/E ratio. Quality businesses often deserve premium valuations.'
      },
      {
        id: 2,

        question: 'Compare your selected company to one of its major competitors. Analyze both companies across business model, competitive positioning, financial metrics (growth, margins, ROIC), and valuation. Which company represents the better investment opportunity and why? Consider both the quality of the business and the price you\'re paying.',
        guidance: 'This is expert-level analysis. Provide a balanced view covering qualitative factors (business quality, moats, risks) and quantitative metrics (growth, profitability, valuation).
